Sales Insights Analysis - Supermarket Data (Q1 2019)

Project Overview

This project analyzes supermarket sales data from January to March 2019 to uncover actionable business insights. Using Python and data visualization libraries, I performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends, customer behavior patterns, and profitability drivers.

Total Revenue: $322,966.75
Total Profit: $15,379.37
Average Transaction Value: $322.97
Overall Profit Margin: 4.76%
Top Performers

Best Branch: Giza branch leads in total sales
Best Product Line: Food and Beverages category generates highest revenue and has best customer ratings
Busiest Day: Saturday records the highest sales volume
Peak Hours: Evening period (6pm-9pm) shows maximum customer traffic
Customer Behavior

Member customers generate more revenue than normal customers
Cash is the most preferred payment method
Premium transactions ($600+) represent high-value customer segment
Weekend sales contribute significantly to total revenue
Time Patterns

Evening hours drive the most sales
Clear weekday vs weekend shopping pattern differences
Hourly transaction patterns reveal optimal staffing times
Technical Skills Demonstrated
